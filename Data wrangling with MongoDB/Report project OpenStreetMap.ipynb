    "Why not allowing users to add information in a easier way? Instead of having to add data via a laptop, it would be nice to being able to use a smartphone to automatically add information. How? If you are having a stroll in your city, you could simply use the app of OpenStreet and take a pic of the element you want to add:\n",

As well as changing the way people add information might be counter-productive: if users are not used to having the OpenStreet app, they might continue to add information in the usual way. Another point is that OpenStreet, which is an opensource, would need to create and maintain their application.\n",
    "What would be the pros?\n",
    "Nowadays everyone has a smartphone and people are used to using app in their day to day life. Giving the users the opportunity to simply add a picture, instead of having to write a street name, it also prevents from typos and other human errors. At the same time, contributors can enjoy adding more information, increasing the average count of contributors information. "
