# Exploratory data analysis


Project part of my Udacity certification as Data Analyst. 
In this project I have analysed information about white wine. This tidy dataset contains 4,898 white wine with 11 variables on quantifying the chemical properties of each wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (excellent).


## To run the code

This project requires R and the following libraries installed:

knitr
ggplot2
GGally
dplyr
gridExtra

You will also need to have software RStudio installed to run and execute the Rmd file.

You can open the .html file to have an idea of what has been done. To check the detailed analysis have a look at the project_whitewine.Rmd
