# Exploratory data analysis


Project part of my Udacity certification as Data Analyst. 
In this project I have analysed information about white wine. This tidy dataset contains 4,898 white wine with 11 variables on quantifying the chemical properties of each wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (excellent).


## To run the code

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook.

Udacity recommends our students install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

You can open the .html file to have an idea of what has been done. To check the detailed analysis have a look at the project_whitewine.Rmd
