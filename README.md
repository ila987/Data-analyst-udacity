# Data analyst nanodegree

In this section I have added my projects I have completed for my nanodegree certification.

In particular you can find:
- Data analysis Titanic data in Python
- Data wrangling with MongoDB and Python
- Exploratory data analysis in R.

All the code is my own production and I made it available as reference.
