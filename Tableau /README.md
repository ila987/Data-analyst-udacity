# Tableau analysis


Project part of my Udacity certification as Data Analyst. 
In this project I have analysed information about flights information in the US. The data used in this exercise comes from RITA and contains information about2008 flights delays and performances mostly in the US. The dataset is almost 700MB and definitely has some interesting facts. Before starting, I decided to manually look for other data to extend the current dataset. In fact, airports were mentioned just using the IATA code, making it complex to understand it quickly.
Merging the code with the city names makes the data more understandable


## To run the code

This project requires a version of Tableau.
