# Titanic Survival Analysis


Project part of my Udacity certification on Data Analyst. 
This is an analysis work done on the Titanic data downloaded from Kaggle. We will focus mostly on analysing variables and finding some interesting questions to answer. Few statistical models will be used, the analysis will be mostly done using different kinds of graphs and grouping together variables.


## To run the code

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

Udacity recommends our students install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.
